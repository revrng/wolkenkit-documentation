# wolkenkit-geocaching

wolkenkit-geocaching is a geocaching application.

The idea was to manage caches, starting from creating and hiding the caches to finding them, making it easier for geocaching teams to organize themselves. The application uses the Google Maps API to display the caches on a map.
