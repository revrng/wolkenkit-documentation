# wolkenkit-todomvc

wolkenkit-todomvc is a todo list application.

The idea was to implement the well known [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application based on wolkenkit to enable comparison with other frameworks. The application allows you to manage todos such as noting them, ticking them off or discarding them.
